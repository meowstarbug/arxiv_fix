## How to use

Before you start, make sure you have the following stuff:

-   Python 3 (although I guess 2 would work?)
-   Beautiful Soup 4
-   Requests

Once you're ready with all the packages above, 

-   Put the script in the same folder as your arxiv papers
-   open the command prompt in your current directory
-   make python run the script (usually with something that looks like `python arxiv_fix.py`)

And then you're done :)
